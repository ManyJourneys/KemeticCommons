# KemeticCommons
A common of resources for broke academics, hobbyists and kemetics alike, based on mutual aid and peer-learning

## Overview
Finding reputable and academic resources on the internet is hard, especially if you don't know where to look, right?
And there are paywalls everywhere, which is even worse.
Sometimes it feels like and uphill battle to go beyond the Wikipedia-style basics and/or Budge and ancient aliens bullshit (shudder), but it does not have to be this way.
We are a community of practice and a community of learning and our aim is to help each other find the right sources for our personal research projects, share recommendations and notes on academic material and create recommended reading lists/primers for relevant topics

## Structure
The projects is constituted of 
1. A list of free/freemium sources for academic and semi-academic content that people can more or less easily access to sate their craving for Ancient Egyptian archeology, culture and religion
2. Specific lists of resources on specific Ancient Egyptian deities or other topics of interest, reviewed by the community
3. Notes on selected publications which are hard/expensive to find, heavily paywalled, or not in English

## What you will find here
1. Robust language
2. Sarcasm
3. A supportive community of people who are learning together.

## What you will not find here
1. The full texts of the papers/resources. Because of legal reasons, essentially, but we will link to freely accessible resources
2. Budge, because his works are outdated and heavily orientalist/racist.
3. C/r/ow/le/y, because he was a racist moron.
4. Ancient Aliens. Like, seriously, that stuff is racist AF
